This project brings a page with a video and some buttons with JS functions that allow the user to do those commands:

first and second buttons allow the user to go back or forward in time by 3 seconds
the next two button slow down ou make the video go faster by 0.2 seconds
and the last two buttons: the first one plays the video and the second stop it, by doing that reseting its time.
